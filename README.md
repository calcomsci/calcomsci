### Hello, world👋

I'm Hector Perio 👨‍💻

Bay Area, California resident for nearly twenty continuous years, close to the heart of Silicon Valley

I started coding in C++ and Java around 2005-ish, and I still code C++ to this day. It's my default programming language of choice.

Around 2017, I coded in Python for data analysis and data science.

Recently, I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for front end software development.

In this repo, you'll see what I did to learn the front end programming languages.
