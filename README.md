### Hello, worldðŸ‘‹

I'm Hector Perio :man_technologist:

Bay Area, California resident for nearly twenty continuous years, close to the heart of Silicon Valley

I started coding in C++ and Java around 2005-ish, and I still code C++ to this day. It's my default programming language of choice.

Around 2017, I coded in Python for data analysis and data science.

Recently, I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for front end software development.

In this repo, you'll see everything I've done with the front end languages.
